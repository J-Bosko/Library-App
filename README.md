The application consists of several classes, with the main one being the Main class. More specifically, the classes are Main, Book, Category, LibraryManager, ListOfUsers, User, UserSearch, Loan, and Comment. Below is a description of the functionality that each class performs:    Main: This is the initial class and the first window of the application that appears after startup. It creates a window for the administrator to log in or for a user to register. In the case of an administrator login attempt, if it is incorrect, an error message appears, while a successful login directs the administrator to a new page with three buttons for categories, books, and the list of registered users. Each button leads to a new page of a different class, which will be analyzed later. In the case of a user registration attempt, if it fails (e.g., another user exists with the same ID or email), a corresponding message appears on the user's screen. If the registration is successful, the user is added to the user list and directed to a new page of the UserSearch class for book search, which will be explained below.    Book: This class provides windows that appear to both users and administrators. It creates a new window for the administrator with buttons for adding and viewing all books. By pressing the "Add" button, the administrator is prompted to correctly fill out all fields (title, author, publisher, ISBN, publication year, category, and number of copies) to successfully add a book and save it to the list of all books. By pressing the "View All Books" button, a window opens displaying the list of all book titles, with buttons next to each title for viewing details (title, author, publisher, ISBN, year of publication, category, and number of copies), editing the title, and deleting the book. Regarding the user, when they successfully search for a book, the title and details of the book will be displayed, along with other buttons from different classes.    Category: In this class, a new window is created for the administrator with a button to add a category. Below this, existing book categories that have been added by the administrator are displayed in a list. Next to each category, there are two buttons: one for deleting the category, which removes it from the list when pressed, and another for editing the category's title, allowing the administrator to change the category name and save it again to the list.    User: In this class, there is no graphical element that adds anything to the application’s appearance. However, it includes essential methods for user functions that are needed in many other classes and are called when necessary.    UserSearch: This class contains the methods used when a user successfully registers. A window opens with a button for material search, and when the user clicks it, they are directed to a new window with three different fields: title, author, and year of publication. Depending on which field the user fills in, and if the information exists in a book, a new window will open displaying the book’s title at the top and four buttons below:        "View Book," which opens a window showing the book details along with a button to close the window;        "View Comments," which displays the list of comments made by other users for the specific book;        "Loan Book," which, if copies are available, loans the book to the user (if not, an error message appears);        "Add Comment," which allows the user to add a comment that will be saved to the comment list. Lastly, the button "Add Rating" allows the user to add a rating for the book from 1 to 5 (otherwise, an error message is printed), and the rating is saved.    Loan: This class contains methods for loaning a book, which are called by other classes when a button is pressed. This class does not contain any graphical elements.    ListOfUsers: In this class, a list of users is created and updated whenever a new user registers. It also contains the method for displaying this user list, which is called by many other classes. It contains three buttons: one for deleting a user, which, when pressed by the administrator, deletes the specific user; one for editing user information, which allows the administrator to modify the user’s details; and one for "Active Loans," which shows the specific user's active loans.    LibraryManager: This class checks if all fields are filled during a new user registration and prints the corresponding error messages. It calls methods from other classes for adding, deleting, and editing books and categories, as well as for deleting users and managing loans.    Comment: This class contains methods for adding comments and ratings for each book and saving them to a list so that they can be reused. These methods are called by other classes when a related button is pressed.
